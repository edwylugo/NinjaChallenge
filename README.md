# Ninja Challenge #

### Requirements ###

The goal of this exercise is to let you show your programming skills in Android. But
don’t worry, the requirements are quite simple!
You need to implement an app that:
- Has two screens:
- One of them should be a list of posts. You should show at least the
title for each of them. There is no predefined UI for the list, so here is
your chance to impress us!
- The other screen should be the post's details. This screen should
have at least the post title, the post body and the author's name.
- You can fetch the posts and authors using the following endpoints:
- http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
- Kotlin is not required, but preferable
- Compiles and runs from Android Studio
(Refer to http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com for more information)

### What we will look for ###

Clean, elegant and maintainable code
- Clear architecture which takes in consideration SOLID principles

- Usage of third party libraries to deal with common platform patterns (Retrofit,
Dagger, etc) - feel free to use any lib that will ease your work
